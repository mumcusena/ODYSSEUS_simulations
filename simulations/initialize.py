Comments are NOT allowed inside data sections.\n#\n# * Do not change the order in which sections appear, neither the order\n#   of data fields in each section.\n#\n# * Each data section has a version number of the form yyyy-mm-dd that is\n#   written in the corresponding section title. Should an incorrect\n#   version be introduced an error message would be issued and the\n#   execution halted.\n#\n# * Character strings (e.g. file names) are introduced in free-format\n#   style, that is, leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Their\n#   maximum extension (except when noted) is 80 characters and they must\n#   not contain blanks. Thus, for instance, 'stainless steel' should be\n#   introduced as 'stainlessSteel' or 'stainless_Steel'.\n#\n# * Most syntax errors can be easily identified by looking for error\n#   messages or inconsistencies within the last lines of penEasy output.\n#   It is always a good idea to check the output to make sure that the\n#   information written after processing each section coincides with what\n#   is expected from the input.\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION CONFIG\n#\n# * Details on the simulation configuration are provided with their\n#   documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n\n[SECTION CONFIG v.2013-03-18]\n 4.0e9             NUMBER OF HISTORIES (1.0e15 MAX)\n 20000             ALLOTTED TIME (s) (+ FOR REAL TIME; - FOR CPU TIME)\n 100.0             UPDATE INTERVAL (s)\n 1  1              INITIAL RANDOM SEEDS\n -                 SEEDS FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=0,0 TO APPLY\n -                 RESTART FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=-1,-1 TO APPLY\n penEasy.dmp       OUTPUT DUMP FILE; ENTER '-' FOR 'NO DUMP'\n 1200.0            INTERVAL BETWEEN DUMPS (s)\n[END OF CONFIG SECTION]\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE SECTIONS\n#\n# * Details on the features and configuration of each source model are\n#   provided with their documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n#   Notice that there must be one and only one active (status ON) source model.\n\n[SECTION SOURCE BOX ISOTROPIC GAUSS SPECTRUM v.2014-12-21]\n ON                              STATUS (ON or OFF)\n 2                               PARTICLE TYPE (1=ELECTRON, 2=PHOTON, 3=POSITRON)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PHOTON POLARIZATION:\n 0                               ACTIVATE PHOTON POLARIZATION PHYSICS (0=NO, 1=YES)\n 0.0 0.0 0.0                     STOKES PARAMETERS (UNUSED IF ACTIVATE POLARIZATION=0)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE POSITION:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   COORDINATES (cm) OF BOX CENTER\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   BOX SIDES (cm)\n 0.0  0.0                        FWHMs (cm) OF GAUSSIAN X,Y DISTRIBUTIONS\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   EULER ANGLES [OMEGA,THETA,PHI](deg) FOR BOX ROTATION Rz(PHI).Ry(THETA).Rz(OMEGA).r\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   TRANSLATION [DX,DY,DZ](cm) OF BOX CENTER POSITION\n 0                               SOURCE MATERIAL (0=DON'T CARE, >0 FOR LOCAL SOURCE, <0 FOR IN-FIELD BEAM)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE DIRECTION:\n 0.0  0.0  1.0                   DIRECTION VECTOR; NO NEED TO NORMALIZE\n 0.0 2.57                        DIRECTION POLAR ANGLE INTERVAL [THETA0,THETA1], BOTH VALUES IN [0,180]deg\n 0.0 360.0                       DIRECTION AZIMUTHAL ANGLE INTERVAL PHI0 IN [0,360)deg AND DeltaPHI IN [0,360]deg\n 1                               APPLY ALSO TO DIRECTION THE ROTATION USED FOR BOX POSITION (0=NO, 1=YES)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE ENERGY:\n {}.spc                    ENERGY SPECTRUM FILE NAME; ENTER '-' TO ENTER SPECTRUM IN NEXT LINES\n 0.0                             FWHM(eV) OF GAUSSIAN ENERGY DISTRIB.

Comments are NOT allowed inside data sections.\n#\n# * Do not change the order in which sections appear, neither the order\n#   of data fields in each section.\n#\n# * Each data section has a version number of the form yyyy-mm-dd that is\n#   written in the corresponding section title. Should an incorrect\n#   version be introduced an error message would be issued and the\n#   execution halted.\n#\n# * Character strings (e.g. file names) are introduced in free-format\n#   style, that is, leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Their\n#   maximum extension (except when noted) is 80 characters and they must\n#   not contain blanks. Thus, for instance, 'stainless steel' should be\n#   introduced as 'stainlessSteel' or 'stainless_Steel'.\n#\n# * Most syntax errors can be easily identified by looking for error\n#   messages or inconsistencies within the last lines of penEasy output.\n#   It is always a good idea to check the output to make sure that the\n#   information written after processing each section coincides with what\n#   is expected from the input.\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION CONFIG\n#\n# * Details on the simulation configuration are provided with their\n#   documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n\n[SECTION CONFIG v.2013-03-18]\n 4.0e9             NUMBER OF HISTORIES (1.0e15 MAX)\n 20000             ALLOTTED TIME (s) (+ FOR REAL TIME; - FOR CPU TIME)\n 100.0             UPDATE INTERVAL (s)\n 1  1              INITIAL RANDOM SEEDS\n -                 SEEDS FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=0,0 TO APPLY\n -                 RESTART FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=-1,-1 TO APPLY\n penEasy.dmp       OUTPUT DUMP FILE; ENTER '-' FOR 'NO DUMP'\n 1200.0            INTERVAL BETWEEN DUMPS (s)\n[END OF CONFIG SECTION]\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE SECTIONS\n#\n# * Details on the features and configuration of each source model are\n#   provided with their documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n#   Notice that there must be one and only one active (status ON) source model.\n\n[SECTION SOURCE BOX ISOTROPIC GAUSS SPECTRUM v.2014-12-21]\n ON                              STATUS (ON or OFF)\n 2                               PARTICLE TYPE (1=ELECTRON, 2=PHOTON, 3=POSITRON)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PHOTON POLARIZATION:\n 0                               ACTIVATE PHOTON POLARIZATION PHYSICS (0=NO, 1=YES)\n 0.0 0.0 0.0                     STOKES PARAMETERS (UNUSED IF ACTIVATE POLARIZATION=0)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE POSITION:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   COORDINATES (cm) OF BOX CENTER\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   BOX SIDES (cm)\n 0.0  0.0                        FWHMs (cm) OF GAUSSIAN X,Y DISTRIBUTIONS\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   EULER ANGLES [OMEGA,THETA,PHI](deg) FOR BOX ROTATION Rz(PHI).Ry(THETA).Rz(OMEGA).r\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   TRANSLATION [DX,DY,DZ](cm) OF BOX CENTER POSITION\n 0                               SOURCE MATERIAL (0=DON'T CARE, >0 FOR LOCAL SOURCE, <0 FOR IN-FIELD BEAM)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE DIRECTION:\n 0.0  0.0  1.0                   DIRECTION VECTOR; NO NEED TO NORMALIZE\n 0.0 2.57                        DIRECTION POLAR ANGLE INTERVAL [THETA0,THETA1], BOTH VALUES IN [0,180]deg\n 0.0 360.0                       DIRECTION AZIMUTHAL ANGLE INTERVAL PHI0 IN [0,360)deg AND DeltaPHI IN [0,360]deg\n 1                               APPLY ALSO TO DIRECTION THE ROTATION USED FOR BOX POSITION (0=NO, 1=YES)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE ENERGY:\n {}.spc                    ENERGY SPECTRUM FILE NAME; ENTER '-' TO ENTER SPECTRUM IN NEXT LINES\n 0.0                             FWHM(eV) OF GAUSSIAN ENERGY DISTRIB.

Comments are NOT allowed inside data sections.\n#\n# * Do not change the order in which sections appear, neither the order\n#   of data fields in each section.\n#\n# * Each data section has a version number of the form yyyy-mm-dd that is\n#   written in the corresponding section title. Should an incorrect\n#   version be introduced an error message would be issued and the\n#   execution halted.\n#\n# * Character strings (e.g. file names) are introduced in free-format\n#   style, that is, leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Their\n#   maximum extension (except when noted) is 80 characters and they must\n#   not contain blanks. Thus, for instance, 'stainless steel' should be\n#   introduced as 'stainlessSteel' or 'stainless_Steel'.\n#\n# * Most syntax errors can be easily identified by looking for error\n#   messages or inconsistencies within the last lines of penEasy output.\n#   It is always a good idea to check the output to make sure that the\n#   information written after processing each section coincides with what\n#   is expected from the input.\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION CONFIG\n#\n# * Details on the simulation configuration are provided with their\n#   documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n\n[SECTION CONFIG v.2013-03-18]\n 4.0e9             NUMBER OF HISTORIES (1.0e15 MAX)\n 20000             ALLOTTED TIME (s) (+ FOR REAL TIME; - FOR CPU TIME)\n 100.0             UPDATE INTERVAL (s)\n 1  1              INITIAL RANDOM SEEDS\n -                 SEEDS FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=0,0 TO APPLY\n -                 RESTART FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=-1,-1 TO APPLY\n penEasy.dmp       OUTPUT DUMP FILE; ENTER '-' FOR 'NO DUMP'\n 1200.0            INTERVAL BETWEEN DUMPS (s)\n[END OF CONFIG SECTION]\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE SECTIONS\n#\n# * Details on the features and configuration of each source model are\n#   provided with their documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n#   Notice that there must be one and only one active (status ON) source model.\n\n[SECTION SOURCE BOX ISOTROPIC GAUSS SPECTRUM v.2014-12-21]\n ON                              STATUS (ON or OFF)\n 2                               PARTICLE TYPE (1=ELECTRON, 2=PHOTON, 3=POSITRON)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PHOTON POLARIZATION:\n 0                               ACTIVATE PHOTON POLARIZATION PHYSICS (0=NO, 1=YES)\n 0.0 0.0 0.0                     STOKES PARAMETERS (UNUSED IF ACTIVATE POLARIZATION=0)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE POSITION:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   COORDINATES (cm) OF BOX CENTER\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   BOX SIDES (cm)\n 0.0  0.0                        FWHMs (cm) OF GAUSSIAN X,Y DISTRIBUTIONS\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   EULER ANGLES [OMEGA,THETA,PHI](deg) FOR BOX ROTATION Rz(PHI).Ry(THETA).Rz(OMEGA).r\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   TRANSLATION [DX,DY,DZ](cm) OF BOX CENTER POSITION\n 0                               SOURCE MATERIAL (0=DON'T CARE, >0 FOR LOCAL SOURCE, <0 FOR IN-FIELD BEAM)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE DIRECTION:\n 0.0  0.0  1.0                   DIRECTION VECTOR; NO NEED TO NORMALIZE\n 0.0 2.57                        DIRECTION POLAR ANGLE INTERVAL [THETA0,THETA1], BOTH VALUES IN [0,180]deg\n 0.0 360.0                       DIRECTION AZIMUTHAL ANGLE INTERVAL PHI0 IN [0,360)deg AND DeltaPHI IN [0,360]deg\n 1                               APPLY ALSO TO DIRECTION THE ROTATION USED FOR BOX POSITION (0=NO, 1=YES)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE ENERGY:\n {}.spc                    ENERGY SPECTRUM FILE NAME; ENTER '-' TO ENTER SPECTRUM IN NEXT LINES\n 0.0                             FWHM(eV) OF GAUSSIAN ENERGY DISTRIB.

Comments are NOT allowed inside data sections.\n#\n# * Do not change the order in which sections appear, neither the order\n#   of data fields in each section.\n#\n# * Each data section has a version number of the form yyyy-mm-dd that is\n#   written in the corresponding section title. Should an incorrect\n#   version be introduced an error message would be issued and the\n#   execution halted.\n#\n# * Character strings (e.g. file names) are introduced in free-format\n#   style, that is, leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Their\n#   maximum extension (except when noted) is 80 characters and they must\n#   not contain blanks. Thus, for instance, 'stainless steel' should be\n#   introduced as 'stainlessSteel' or 'stainless_Steel'.\n#\n# * Most syntax errors can be easily identified by looking for error\n#   messages or inconsistencies within the last lines of penEasy output.\n#   It is always a good idea to check the output to make sure that the\n#   information written after processing each section coincides with what\n#   is expected from the input.\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION CONFIG\n#\n# * Details on the simulation configuration are provided with their\n#   documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n\n[SECTION CONFIG v.2013-03-18]\n 4.0e9             NUMBER OF HISTORIES (1.0e15 MAX)\n 20000             ALLOTTED TIME (s) (+ FOR REAL TIME; - FOR CPU TIME)\n 100.0             UPDATE INTERVAL (s)\n 1  1              INITIAL RANDOM SEEDS\n -                 SEEDS FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=0,0 TO APPLY\n -                 RESTART FILE; MUST ENTER SEEDS=-1,-1 TO APPLY\n penEasy.dmp       OUTPUT DUMP FILE; ENTER '-' FOR 'NO DUMP'\n 1200.0            INTERVAL BETWEEN DUMPS (s)\n[END OF CONFIG SECTION]\n\n\n# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE SECTIONS\n#\n# * Details on the features and configuration of each source model are\n#   provided with their documentation (see ~/documentation/*).\n#   Notice that there must be one and only one active (status ON) source model.\n\n[SECTION SOURCE BOX ISOTROPIC GAUSS SPECTRUM v.2014-12-21]\n ON                              STATUS (ON or OFF)\n 2                               PARTICLE TYPE (1=ELECTRON, 2=PHOTON, 3=POSITRON)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PHOTON POLARIZATION:\n 0                               ACTIVATE PHOTON POLARIZATION PHYSICS (0=NO, 1=YES)\n 0.0 0.0 0.0                     STOKES PARAMETERS (UNUSED IF ACTIVATE POLARIZATION=0)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE POSITION:\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   COORDINATES (cm) OF BOX CENTER\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   BOX SIDES (cm)\n 0.0  0.0                        FWHMs (cm) OF GAUSSIAN X,Y DISTRIBUTIONS\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   EULER ANGLES [OMEGA,THETA,PHI](deg) FOR BOX ROTATION Rz(PHI).Ry(THETA).Rz(OMEGA).r\n 0.0  0.0  0.0                   TRANSLATION [DX,DY,DZ](cm) OF BOX CENTER POSITION\n 0                               SOURCE MATERIAL (0=DON'T CARE, >0 FOR LOCAL SOURCE, <0 FOR IN-FIELD BEAM)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE DIRECTION:\n 0.0  0.0  1.0                   DIRECTION VECTOR; NO NEED TO NORMALIZE\n 0.0 2.57                        DIRECTION POLAR ANGLE INTERVAL [THETA0,THETA1], BOTH VALUES IN [0,180]deg\n 0.0 360.0                       DIRECTION AZIMUTHAL ANGLE INTERVAL PHI0 IN [0,360)deg AND DeltaPHI IN [0,360]deg\n 1                               APPLY ALSO TO DIRECTION THE ROTATION USED FOR BOX POSITION (0=NO, 1=YES)\n  SUBSECTION FOR PARTICLE ENERGY:\n {}.spc                    ENERGY SPECTRUM FILE NAME; ENTER '-' TO ENTER SPECTRUM IN NEXT LINES\n 0.0                             FWHM(eV) OF GAUSSIAN ENERGY DISTRIB.
